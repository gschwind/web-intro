## Events

* Due to the specificity of the browser and the network, Javascript within the browser is not driven like other langage
  * there is no main() function that run forever
  * It is not driven like video game with infinite loop that eat all the CPU
  * Instead Javascript is driven by **Events**
* Events can have diferent nature:
  * Events can come from the user activity like mouse click
  * Events can be fired by code
  * Events can be fired because some network data is available
* mostly "load" that is rather crucial
* there are also builtin events for keyboard / mouse interaction illustrated on the next example (we use `click` and `keydown`)
* for more details, see [this section in javascript.info](https://javascript.info/event-details) on all the vailable events
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## Code generated events

* Events can create your own event by code using :

```javascript
const event = new Event('myevent');

// Listen for the event.
elem.addEventListener('myevent', foo, false);

// Dispatch the event.
elem.dispatchEvent(event);
```

* You can create timed event:

```javascript

setTimeout(foo, 3000); // call foo in 3000 ms

setInterval(foo, 3000); // call foo every 3000 ms

```

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## Callback

* Events are handled using callbacks,
* Callback are functions that is called when an event occur
* To get a function to be called on a given event you have to use the `addEventListener`

For exemple to have the function `foo` called when the page is loaded you can use the following code:

```javascript
// trigger once the document is loaded
window.addEventListener(
    "load", 
    foo
);
```

Where `load` is the name of the event corresponding to the end of the page load.

* Several event are available a list of some of them is [here w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## Anonymous function, i.e. lambda

Due to the extensive use of callbacks in javacript, giving name to each fonction that we use once per event we setup is anoying. For this reason javascript have a 2 conveniant way to create anonymous functions.

* The fist one, the legacy-one:
```javascript
let mylambda0 = function (arg0, arg1) { /* some code here */ };
```
* The second one, the new fashion:
```javascript
let mylambda0 = (arg0, arg1) => { /* some code here */ };
```
* /!\ Both variant are valid, even is the new on look nicer
* Even if they look the same, they have subtile diference not covered here
* In this course you can use both.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## Anonymous function usage

in this context, it is common to create functions **on the fly** with e.g. the `function` expression

```javascript
window.addEventListener(
    "load", 
    // returns a function object
    function() { console.log("page loaded"); }  
);
```
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## Closures
<!-- #endregion -->

* it is rather frequent that a callback needs to access data that sit outside the function context
* it is safe to use lexically-bound variables inside the callback
* see the `context` variable in the example below

```javascript
// here the 'context' variable is not visible
{ 
    let context = {a:1, b:2};
    setTimeout( 
        function() {
            // Here the 'context' variable is visible and remain valid
            // even if we leave the block
            console.log("context is", context);
        },
        2000);
    console.log("NOW timeout armed");
} 
// here neither
try {
    context
} catch(err) {
    console.log(`OOPS ${err.message}`)
}
```

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
### closures - continued
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region cell_style="split" -->
```javascript
{ 
  let context = {a:1, b:2};
  setTimeout( 
    function() {
      console.log(context);
    },
    2000);
  console.log("armed");
}
```
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region cell_style="split" -->
* `context` is created in a block
* that is long gone at the time the callback triggers
* but it is still reachable from the callback
* as it was *captured* in the closure
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## the limits of callbacks
<!-- #endregion -->

* highly recommended to study the [introduction to callbacks in javascript.info](https://javascript.info/callbacks)
* that highlights the fundamental drawback of using callbacks
* which is that you need to split your code into pieces and fit the pieces into functions
* it easily becomes hard to read and modify especially if there is logic involved


so far we have seen a few types of events

* mostly "load" that is rather crucial
* there are also builtin events for keyboard / mouse interaction illustrated on the next example (we use `click` and `keydown`)
* for more details, see [this section in javascript.info](https://javascript.info/event-details) on all the vailable events

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
### `addEventListener`
<!-- #endregion -->

* a fundamental tool to record callback with an event
* available on most objects
* observe on the example how the callbacks receive the event in parameter
* and because we use `console.log(event)` we have the option to inspect the event object in the console, and see all its attributes

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
### Events example

```javascript hide_input=true
tools.from_samples("35-async-01-events", {separate_show: true, width: '40em'})
```

### Example - observations
<!-- #endregion -->

notice from the exampleÂ :

* how `addEventLister()` are cascaded, just like in the 'pyramid of Doom`
* how we display the events with `console.log()`  
  this is useful technique for debugging / inspecting data
* how we inspect the event object to display meaningful data
* also that the `.js` file does not export any symbol 

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"} -->
## Promises
<!-- #endregion -->

a relatively new alternative to callbacks that tries to address the 'pyramid of Doom' as described in the article mentioned above

the following example tries to illustrate

* that promises can deal with error conditions
* and that they allow to pass return values along the chain

as you will see however, it clearly gets some time to be able to read promises fluently :)

```javascript slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"}
// this is just an accessory cell

// we declare a variable that will 

// the next cell will run OK 
// for the first time
// and fail for the second time

failure_toggle = 1
```

```javascript slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"}
new Promise(
    function(resolve, reject) {

        // make it work or fail every other time
        failure_toggle = ! failure_toggle;
      
        // a promise must use resolve or reject exactly once
        // depending on successful or not
        if ( failure_toggle) {
            // in case of failure, do not wait
            reject(1);
        } else {
            // in case of success, wait for 1 s
            setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 500);
        }
    }).then(
        // first argument to then is in case of success (resolve is used)
        (result) => { console.log(result); 
                      return result * 2;},
        // second is for the cases where reject is called
        (result) => console.log(`error with ${result}`)
    ).then(
      function(result) { 
          console.log(result); 
          return result * 3;
});
```

### more on promises and async

for those interested, more details on promises can be found in the rest of [this chapter on javascript.info](https://javascript.info/async) [starting here](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)
<!-- #endregion -->

## `async` keyword 


With `async` you can delare fonction that are `Promise` by default

```javascript
// when called this fonction will be a promise as the previous code
async function foo() {
        // make it work or fail every other time
        failure_toggle = ! failure_toggle;
      
        // a promise must use resolve or reject exactly once
        // depending on successful or not
        if ( failure_toggle) {
            // in case of failure, do not wait
            throw 1; // Equivalent to reject(1);
        } else {
            // in case of success, wait for 1 s
            return 1; // Equivalent to resolve(1);
        }
    }

// Call the function as promise
foo().then(
        // first argument to then is in case of success (resolve is used)
        (result) => { console.log(result); 
                      return result * 2;},
        // second is for the cases where reject is called
        (result) => console.log(`error with ${result}`)
).then(
      function(result) { 
          console.log(result); 
          return result * 3;
});
```

## `await` keyword


* The keyword `await` allow to wait for the result of a promise
* `await` can only used in `async` function
* They cannot be used in the global scope

```javascript
async function foo() {
    // make it work or fail every other time
    failure_toggle = ! failure_toggle;

    // a promise must use resolve or reject exactly once
    // depending on successful or not
    if ( failure_toggle) {
        // in case of failure, do not wait
        throw 1; // Equivalent to reject(1);
    } else {
        // in case of success, wait for 1 s
        return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(1) , 3000));
    }
}

// Call the function as promise
foo().then(
        // first argument to then is in case of success (resolve is used)
        (result) => { console.log(result); 
                      return result * 2;},
        // second is for the cases where reject is called
        (result) => console.log(`error with ${result}`)
).then(
      function(result) { 
          console.log(result); 
          return result * 3;
});
```
